# FixMyChoo

Small mod for Obenseuer.
Makes some minor improvements and bugfixes to the minitrains.  Of note, it will rerail trains that have been "confused" by being displaced during a tenement upgrade.

## Installation

Just like all other Obenseuer mods, you must first have BepInEx installed.
Once that is done, put FixMyChoo.dll in the Obenseuer/BepInEx/plugins folder.

## Configuration

After running the game once, a config file will be created at BepInEx/Config/FixMyChoo.cfg
Open in any text editor while the game is closed.
