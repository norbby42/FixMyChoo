# FixMyChoo

Small mod for Obenseuer that applies a bugfix to the minitrains: it will separate wagons that are "ghost" attached to each other (ie they move at the same time, but are not physically coupled).

## Installation

Just like all other Obenseuer mods, you must first have BepInEx installed (https://stalburg.net/Obenseuer/Modding).
Once that is done, extract the .zip to your Obenseuer/BepInEx/plugins folder.  It should result in a folder structure of: Obenseuer/BepInEx/plugins/FixMyChoo
If you have an older version of the mod that was a dll placed directly in the plugins folder, please delete that dll.

## Configuration

After running the game once, a config file will be created at BepInEx/Config/FixMyChoo.cfg
Open in any text editor while the game is closed.
